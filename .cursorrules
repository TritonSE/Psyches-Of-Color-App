# Cursor Rules for Psyches of Color App

## Git Commit Guidelines

### Conventional Commit Format

All commits MUST follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Commit Types

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
- `ci`: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
- `chore`: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- `revert`: Reverts a previous commit

### Scope

The scope should be the name of the package/component affected:

- `backend`: Backend changes
- `frontend`: Frontend changes
- `admin-portal`: Admin portal changes
- Specific component/service name (e.g., `auth`, `user`, `activity`)

### Commit Message Format

**Format:**

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Examples:**

```
fix(backend): correct import path in auth.ts

- Change import path from '../src/services/firebase' to 'src/services/firebase'
- Configure tsconfig.json with baseUrl to support absolute imports
- Resolves TypeScript module resolution error
```

```
feat(frontend): add user profile page

- Create profile page component
- Add profile editing functionality
- Connect to user API endpoint
```

```
docs: update README with setup instructions

- Add environment variable setup steps
- Include MongoDB connection instructions
- Update dependency installation guide
```

### Commit Rules

1. **Always use conventional commit format** when committing changes
2. **Type and scope are required** - always include them
3. **Subject line should be imperative, present tense** - "add feature" not "added feature" or "adds feature"
4. **Subject line should not end with a period**
5. **Subject line should be 72 characters or less**
6. **Body is optional but recommended** for complex changes
7. **Body should explain the "what" and "why"** of the change
8. **Use bullet points in body** for multiple changes
9. **Reference issue numbers** in footer if applicable: `Closes #123`

### Automatic Committing

**ALWAYS commit changes automatically after making them. DO NOT ask for permission to commit.**

After making any code changes:

1. Review all changes made (use `git status` and `git diff` if needed)
2. Stage all changed files: `git add <files>`
3. Determine the appropriate type and scope based on the changes
4. Write a clear, descriptive commit message following conventional commit format
5. Include a body with bullet points describing the changes
6. Execute `git commit -m "..."` with the formatted message
7. If pre-commit hooks fail due to unrelated issues (e.g., frontend lint warnings when only backend was changed), use `--no-verify` flag only after verifying:
   - The changes are correct and complete
   - Lint issues are unrelated to your changes
   - Your changes pass lint checks when tested independently

**Commit immediately after completing a change or set of related changes. Never leave uncommitted changes unless explicitly asked by the user.**

### Examples of Good Commit Messages

```
fix(backend): resolve MongoDB connection timeout

- Increase connection timeout to 30 seconds
- Add retry logic for failed connections
- Update error handling for connection errors
```

```
feat(frontend): implement journal entry creation

- Create journal entry form component
- Add validation for journal entry fields
- Connect to journal entries API
- Add success/error notifications
```

```
refactor(auth): simplify authentication middleware

- Extract token verification logic to separate function
- Improve error messages
- Add JSDoc comments for better documentation
```

```
chore: update dependencies

- Update Express to v4.21.2
- Update TypeScript to v5.7.2
- Update React Native to latest stable version
```

### Bad Commit Messages (DO NOT USE)

❌ `fixed bug`
❌ `update files`
❌ `changes`
❌ `WIP`
❌ `fix: fixed the bug`
❌ `feat: added new feature that does stuff and things`

### Pre-commit Hooks

The project uses Husky pre-commit hooks that:

- Run lint checks on backend and frontend
- Check for secret leaks
- Verify code formatting

If lint checks fail, fix the issues before committing. If you need to bypass hooks (not recommended), use `--no-verify` flag, but only after verifying that:

1. The changes are correct
2. Lint issues are unrelated to your changes
3. You have a valid reason to bypass

## Code Style

- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Use relative imports when files are in the same directory (absolute imports require runtime configuration)
- Follow ESLint and Prettier rules
- Write clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public functions and complex logic
- After making changes, automatically commit them using conventional commit format

## Project Structure

- `backend/`: Node.js/Express backend
- `frontend/`: React Native mobile app
- `admin-portal/`: Next.js admin portal

Each directory has its own `package.json` and dependencies.
